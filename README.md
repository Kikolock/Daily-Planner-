## Technologies used and why.

For this project, I need to create a application as a simple calendar that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day. Using Moment.js and Bootstrap is a requirement for this challenge! 
During this project I had been trough challenges as searching online for the JavaScript functions and how to use them in order to have the best outcome. Using HTML and CSS interface, the power from JavaScript will give the function to the page. Also using the power of Jquery and Bootstrap to have a better view and performance for the website.

## Challenges for future improvement

A good thing to improve for future is to implement a live hour timer instead to refresh the page every time to see the actual hour. Also creating a calendar to make the user able to navigate to past and future dates in order to create different plans along the year.

## The Project

This challenge consists in creating a daily planner to help organize the tasks through the day:

- When open the page, the current day and time is displayed at the top of the calendar
- When scrolling down, the user is able to see time blocks for standard business hours
- Each block is color-coded to indicate whether it is not in the past, present or future
- Clicking into a time block, the user can make changes and save those changes in local storage
- When refresh the page, the saved events persist
